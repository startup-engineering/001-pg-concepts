The quotes are
from this <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-strong-beliefs-on-culture-for-entrepreneurialism-did-Peter-Max-and-David-have-at-PayPal?share=1">Quora thread</a>.)</i><br><br>June 28, 2010<br><br>Why did so many successful entrepreneurs and startups come out of
PayPal? I long have been fascinated by the extraordinary achievement
from the ex-Paypal team and wonder about the reasons behind their
success. In the past, mass media tried to answer this question
several times but still couldn’t give us a clear answer.<br><br>I once asked David Sacks the same question during an event in Los
Angeles. He told me the secret is that Paypal has built a "scrappy"
culture. No matter what problems they faced, they would find a way
to solve them. I kind of got the idea, but was still confused about
the execution details.<br><br>So when I saw some of the past Paypal employees answering this
question on Quora, I was super excited! After all, they should be
the only ones who can tell people the inside stories.<br><br>Below are some highlights of their answers.<br><br>On Talent Management<br><br>"Peter and Max assembled an unusual critical
mass of entrepreneurial talent, primarily due to their ability to
recognize young people with extraordinary ability (the median age
of *execs* on the S1 filing was 30). But the poor economy allowed
us to close an abnormal number of offers, as virtually nobody other
than eBay and (in part) google was hiring in 2000-02." (by Keith
Rabois, former Executive Vice President of Paypal)<br><br>"Extreme Focus (driven by Peter): Peter required that everyone be
tasked with exactly one priority. He would refuse to discuss virtually
anything else with you except what was currently assigned as your
#1 initiative. Even our annual review forms in 2001 required each
employee to identify their single most valuable contribution to the
company." (by Keith Rabois, former Executive Vice President of
Paypal)<br><br>"Dedication to individual accomplishment: Teams were almost considered
socialist institutions. Most great innovations at PayPal were driven
by one person who then conscripted others to support, adopt, implement
the new idea. If you identified the 8-12 most critical innovations
at PayPal (or perhaps even the most important 25), almost every one
had a single person inspire it (and often it drive it to implementation).
As a result, David enforced an anti-meeting culture where any meeting
that included more than 3-4 people was deemed suspect and subject
to immediate adjournment if he gauged it inefficient. Our annual
review forms in 2002 included a direction to rate the employee on
"avoids imposing on others’ time, e.g. scheduling unnecessary
meetings." (by Keith Rabois, former Executive Vice President of
Paypal)<br><br>"Refusal to accept constraints, external or internal:We were expected
to pursue our #1 priority with extreme dispatch (NOW) and vigor.
To borrow an apt phrase, employees were expected to "come to work
every day willing to be fired, to circumvent any order aimed at
stopping your dream." Jeremy Stoppelman has relayed elsewhere the
story about an email he sent around criticizing management that he
expected to get him fired and instead got him promoted. Peter did
not accept no for answer: If you couldn’t solve the problem, someone
else would be soon assigned to do it." (by Keith Rabois, former
Executive Vice President of Paypal)<br><br>"Driven problem solvers: PayPal had a strong bias toward hiring
(and promoting / encouraging, as Keith mentions) smart, driven
problem solvers, rather than subject matter experts. Very few of
the top performers at the company had any prior experience with
payments, and many of the best employees had little or no prior
background building Internet products. I worked on the fraud analytics
team at PayPal, and most of our best people had never before done
anything related to fraud detection. If he’d approached things
"traditionally", Max would have gone out and hired people who had
been building logistic regression models for banks for 20 years but
never innovated, and fraud losses would likely have swallowed the
company." (by Mike Greenfield, former Sr. Fraud R&D Scientist of
Paypal)<br><br>"Self-sufficiency – individuals and small teams were given fairly
complex objectives and expected to figure out how to achieve them
on their own. If you needed to integrate with an outside vendor,
you picked up the phone yourself and called; you didn’t wait for a
BD person to become available. You did (the first version of) mockups
and wireframes yourself; you didn’t wait for a designer to become
available. You wrote (the first draft of) site copy yourself; you
didn’t wait for a content writer." (by Yee Lee, former Product &
BU GM of Paypal)<br><br>On Culture & Ideology<br><br>"Extreme bias towards action – early PayPal
was simply a really *productive* workplace. This was partly driven
by the culture of self-sufficiency. PayPal is and was, after all,
a web service; and the company managed to ship prodigious amounts
of relatively high-quality web software for a lot of years in a row
early on. Yes, we had the usual politics between functional groups,
but either individual heroes or small, high-trust teams more often
than not found ways to deliver projects on-time." (by Yee Lee,
former Product & BU GM of Paypal)<br><br>"Willingness to try – even in a data-driven culture, you’ll always
run in to folks who either don’t believe you have collected the
right supporting data for a given decision or who just aren’t
comfortable when data contradicts their gut feeling. In many
companies, those individuals would be the death of decision-making.
At PayPal, I felt like you could almost always get someone to give
it a *try* and then let performance data tell us whether to maintain
the decision or rollback." (by Yee Lee, former Product & BU GM of
Paypal)<br><br>"Data-driven decision making – PayPal was filled with smart,
opinionated people who were often at logger-heads. The way to win
arguments was to bring data to bear. So you never started a sentence
like this "I feel like it’s a problem that our users can’t do X",
instead you’d do your homework first and then come to the table
with "35% of our [insert some key metric here] are caused by the
lack of X functionality…" (by Yee Lee, former Product & BU GM of
Paypal)<br><br>"Radical transparency on metrics: All employees were expected to
be facile with the metrics driving the business. Otherwise, how
could one expect each employee to make rational calculations and
decisions on their own every day? To enforce this norm, almost every
all-hands meeting consisted of distributing a printed Excel spreadsheet
to the assembled masses and Peter conducting a line by line review
of our performance (this is only a modest exaggeration)." (by Keith
Rabois, former Executive Vice President of Paypal)<br><br>"Vigorous debate, often via email: Almost every important issue had
champions and critics. These were normally resolved not by official
edict but by a vigorous debate that could be very intense. Being
able to articulate and defend a strategy or product in a succinct,
compelling manner with empirical analysis and withstand a withering
critique was a key attribute of almost every key contributor. I
still recall the trepidation I confronted when I was informed that
I needed to defend the feasibility of my favorite "baby" to Max for
the first time." (by Keith Rabois, former Executive Vice President
of Paypal)<br><br>"Extreme Pressure – PayPal was a very difficult business with many
major issues to solve. We were able to see our colleagues work under
extreme pressure and hence we learned who we could rely on and
trust." (by Keith Rabois, former Executive Vice President of Paypal)<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=435><tr><td><font size=2 face="verdana"><br><br><hr></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body>
