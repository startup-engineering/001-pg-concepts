list, Dan Weinreb, one of the designers of Common Lisp, writes about the 
Loop macro.  I consider Loop one of the worst flaws in CL, and an
example to be borne in mind by both macro writers and language designers.)</i><br><br>This was the big competitor to LOOP, back in roughly maybe
 1978-1979 when we all wanted to generalize and extend Maclisp's
 "new style DO".  Each approach had its own merits and demerits.
 I think probably we in the LOOP camp were insufficiently sympathetic
 to the merits of Waters's approach, possibly because we were
 not experienced with lexical scoping, although also because
 there really were a few things that it didn't do as well as
 LOOP.<br><br>LOOP, by the way, is one of the few cases of a macro in which
 we deliberately violated one of the (excellent!) rules that Scott McKay
 enumerated recently on this list.  Namely, we ("what you mean we?",
 really Dave Moon, but others of us were egging him on, so to speak)
 decided to violate the usual stricture that a Lisp special form
 should only have a symbol as the first element of the list, and
 that subsequent "syntax" within the special form should be done
 entirely in terms of the nested list structure.<br><br>After all, we
 were the ones who had introduced keyword arguments into Lisp.
 Those were symbols used at runtime in a sort of syntactic way.
 Here we went the next step further and used symbols at "compile
 time", i.e. statically, i.e. syntactically (e.g. you did not
 have to use QUOTE), as keywords.  So we created one of the first
 Lisp special forms to be keyword-oriented, and I think it may
 be the only such special form that was accepted in Common Lisp.<br><br>(And it was only accepted after very bloody battles were fought,
 as Guy Steele knows better than anyone else, since he was the
 referee of those battles!)<br><br>LOOP was not as much of a success as we had hoped.  To this day
 I firmly stick by our decision to use keywords.  All rules have
 their exceptions, and this was a case where the benefit of using
 keywords outweighed the cost of using unusual syntax.  The use
 of keywords is NOT what was wrong with LOOP.<br><br>Rather, the problem with LOOP was that it turned out to be
 hard to predict what it would do, when you started using a
 lot of different facets of LOOP all together.  This is a
 serious problem since the whole idea of LOOP was to let you
 use many facets together; if you're not doing that, LOOP
 is overkill.  Moon struggled hard to make LOOP more predictable
 and understandable.  Even at the time I did not fully comprehend
 all the issues; now, over 20 years later, I've almost forgotten
 them.  But if Dave Moon could not figure out how to solve the
 problem, I am quite confident that it's a very hard problem to
 solve.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=435><tr><td><font size=2 face="verdana"><br><br><hr></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body>
